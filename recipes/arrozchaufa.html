    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This recipe moves pretty fast so get all of your veggies diced and minces and in order.</li>
        <li>Skinless chicken thighs is the preferred choice. They are full of flavor and they will taste amazing in this dish. If all you have is chicken breast, feel free do use that too.</li>
        <li>If you want to save time, use prepackaged already diced peppers, garlic and onion.</li>
        <li>Mix all these ingredients together in a small bowl: Soy sauce, sesame oil, a pinch or two of sugar, couple pinches of cumin, ground ginger. If you prefer to use fresh add 1 tablespoon. Do not add fresh ginger into the soy sauce mixture.  We will be cooking the ginger with the rest of the veggies.</li>
    </ul>
