    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Marinated strips of sirloin steak stir-fry with soy sauce, chopped red onion, tomatoes, crispy French fries and the unmissable ají amarillo, served with rice on the side.</p>
    <p>Very flavorful, yet not spicy, lomo saltado never fails to impress diners in Peru and beyond. Fortunately, chefs that want to try their hand at preparing it are in luck because this recipe is as simple as it is delicious: you can literally throw it together within minutes and you don’t need many exotic ingredients.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound beef (filet mignon, sirloin, skirt steak, or flank steak) cut into thin slices</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic, minced or grated</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon EACH: oyster sauce AND red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Aji Amarillo paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 medium red onion, sliced into ½ inch wedges</li>
        <li>3 Roma tomatoes, seeds removed and sliced into ½ inch wedges</li>
        <li>Sliced scallions/chopped cilantro, for serving</li>
        <li>Oil, for cooking</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>MARINATE:</strong> Add 1 tablespoons soy sauce and roughly half the garlic, to the thinly sliced beef and allow for the beef to marinate for 5-7 minutes. If you’re using a particularly tough cut of meat, consider adding ¼ teaspoon of baking soda along with the soy sauce and let it marinate for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>SAUCE:</strong> In a small bowl, combine the remaining 4 tablespoons soy sauce, oyster sauce, red wine vinegar, Aji Amarillo paste, and cornstarch. Whisk to combine and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>STIR FRY:</strong> Add about a tablespoon of cooking oil to a hot cast iron pan or wok until it shimmers. Brown the beef for roughly 1-2 minutes flipping as needed to cook evenly. You might want to do this in batches if the pan you’re working with is small. You want the beef to sear, not steam! Remove to a plate. Add another tablespoon of oil if the pan is dry. Add the onions and sauce them for 1 minute before adding the remaining garlic and tomatoes. Continue to sauté for 1 minute, then add the beef back into the pan. You’d also add the French fries here if you wanted to cook them with the sauce. Drizzle with the prepared sauce and toss to combine. Top with sliced scallions or chopped cilantro (or both) and serve warm with rice and with French fries (if you want them crispy!)</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Make sure you cut the steak against the grain. This shortens the length of the muscle fibers and helps make the meat more tender. </li>
        <li>If you can't find <a href="http://google.com/search?q=Peruvian+Aji+Amarillo">Aji Amarillo</a>, you can blend 1/4 of a serrano with 1/4 of yellow bell pepper. It's not exactly the same thing but something similar.</li>
    </ul>
